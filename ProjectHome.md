IMG Rotate is a simple extension that allows the user to rotate images (Clockwise and Counter Clockwise 90 deg at a time) on Chrome. I built the extension for fun and because I got frustrated with receiving pictures on my email sideway which meant I have to save them on my desktop to see them up right. I hope this helps others out there who are looking for something simple and easy.

- Tested on Chrome 11, Chromium 11, and Chrome 13 Canary.

Known Issues:
- Does not work on Chrome Extension website (due to the fact that content scripts are not allowed in this website).
- Does not work on https://mail.google.com (I suspect for the same reason above).
